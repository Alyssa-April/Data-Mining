# Data-Mining
Some data mining tasks carried out for my Master's course.

1. Assignment 1: Tidying up data for simple exploratory data analysis.
2. Assignment 2: Utilise the boxplot method to get an initial overview of outliers in the patient kidney disease dataset. Also employed the Quartile test which is similar to the boxplot method with a usage of statistical values, followed by the Hampel test. The number of outliers identified for each variable by each method are listed down and the most sensitive detection method is chosen to identify the outliers.
3. Project: Time Series Analysis (Only powerpoint presentation is available).
